  text: In the 1980s, this 1847 Greek Revival church building (longtime home of the Brooklyn’s oldest African-American congregation) sat in its original habitat, surrounded by other 19th century low-rise wood and brick buildings. Landmarked in 1981, it survived the 1990s development of neighboring blocks into Downtown Brooklyn’s MetroTech complex and today still stands proudly among the surrounding high-rises, now part of NYU’s School of Engineering.

  text: Hard to believe, but look carefully. VERY carefully. Hiding under the tawdry aluminum siding advertising the 1980s King Fried Chicken lies the landmark Times Plaza Control House in the middle of the intersection of Flatbush, Fourth and Atlantic Avenues. A Flemish Revival style kiosk built in 1908 by Heins & Lafarge as the entrance to the busy IRT subway station underneath, the building was restored to its original appearance in 2005 and now guards the past opposite the ultra-contemporary Barclays Center across the street.

  text: Change comes to old Brooklyn Heights. When a Burger King franchise was first proposed for this historic 1925 building in the landmark district in the mid 1970s, neighborhood opposition ran so strong that protesters wearing “Whopper Stopper” t-shirts picketed the corporate offices. They failed – and by the early 1980s, the neon flame-broiled burgers were shining in the windows here.

  text: Coney Island’s Thunderbolt roller coaster, made even more famous by Woody Allen’s 1977 movie Annie Hall. Allen’s character Alvy Singer explains to Diane Keaton’s Annie that all his neuroses can be traced to the fact he was raised in a small shack right under the rattling tracks. This pic was shot just after the coaster closed down for good in 1982. After almost 20 years of abandonment, it was eventually torn down in 2000.
